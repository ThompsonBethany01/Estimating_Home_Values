# Predicting Home Values for Zillow
## About the Project
### Goals
Zillow first launched in 2006. Since then, our company has accumulated a living database of more than 110 million US homes. Not only do we keep track of homes on the market, but off the market as well. What do we do with this data? One value we create is the [ZestimateÂ®](https://www.zillow.com/zestimate/) - the estimate of a home's market value.  

The purpose of this project is determine what influences this value based on previous property data during the two months of high real estate demand - May and June.
