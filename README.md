# Predicting Home Values for Zillow
## About the Project
### Goals
When someone wants to know the value of a property, our website is often one of the top recommendations. However, there is always room for improvement, and I want to accomplish this improvement with clustering methodologies to determine where error may be coming from.  

So what do we need to beat to make an improvement? Our current model has an error of ____. This project holds the final model with an error of ___, and the files necessary to reproduce it.

Within the acquire.py module, there are functions to:
- connect to the SQL company database (login credentials required)
- read a query to select the data and save to a csv file
- assign the data to a variable
- count the nulls of each columns and calculate the percentage of this
## Prepare
## Explore
