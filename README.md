# Predicting Home Values for Zillow
## About the Project
### Goals
Zillow first launched in 2006. Since then, our company has accumulated a living database of more than 110 million US homes. Not only do we keep track of homes on the market, but off the market as well. What do we do with this data? One value we create is the [Zestimate®](https://www.zillow.com/zestimate/) - the estimate of a home's market value.  

The purpose of this project is determine what influences this value based on previous property data during the two months of high real estate demand - May and June.

Deliverables for this project include:
> - Final model created to predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses
> - A reproducable Github repo containing
>   - Walkthrough of the DS pipeline within a jupyter notebook
>   - Acquire/Prepare modules in .py files
> - Answers for the
>   - States and counties properties are located in
>   - Distribution of tax rates for each county

### Background

How does the current Zestimate® perform? According to [FreeStoneProperties](https://www.freestoneproperties.com/blog/truth-zillow-zestimates/#:~:text=Is%20a%20Zillow%20Zestimate%20High,about%20the%20accuracy%20of%20Zestimates.&text=For%20example%2C%20depending%20on%20the,only%2062%25%20of%20the%20time.),
> "The median error for larger markets is usually around 2% of the sale price of the home. But the problem with Zestimates is 
> that when they are wrong, they can be significantly wrong. For example, depending on the metro area, Zillow might be within 5% 
> of the sale price only 62% of the time."
